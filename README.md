# Test REST API with Python

This is a easy framework for testing REST API by Python.

Requirements:
- Python 3
- PyYAML
- Requests
- XmlToDict

By desire:
- use syntax as following:
    ```
    python <script_name>
    ```
  or install nose
  ```
    sudo pip install nose
  ```
- use python virtualenv and modify env.sh and act.sh for your virtualenv path
- use Jenkins

Folder **base** contents base class which you should override for your testing API. And the folder **youtrack** contens an example of testing some features of YouTrack API from JetBrains. 

Nice testing !
